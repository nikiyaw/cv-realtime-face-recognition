# Real Time Face Recognition Collecting and Training Model

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a real time racial recognition model. 

## Tools and Programming Language(s)
OpenCV, Python, Haar Cascade Classifier

## Process
1. Collect training dataset by taking 30 pictures, obtaining a name and an integer.
2. Train the model with all the data collected.
3. Use the trained model to recognize real time webcam images and provide a name along with a accuracy score.
